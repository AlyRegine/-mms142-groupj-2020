The need to minimize touchpoints has influenced behaviors in a big way. Many have switched to online shopping
to avoid crowds in physical stores. The use of paper bills and coins have also been discouraged to prevent the
further spread of the virus. The shift from cash-only to contact-free payments has almost been overnight.
As think tank McKinsey put it, the pandemic pushed many businesses over the tech tipping point, accelerating
digitization by 3 to even 5 years. 

Against this backdrop, our group decided to explore one touch payment systems using QR
(Quick Response) code technology. </span><span class="v18_7609">We’ll leave experts to explain what QR code technology is. 

“QR i.e. "Quick Response" code is a 2D matrix code that is designed by keeping two points under consideration,
i.e. it must store large amount of data as compared to 1D barcodes and it must be decoded at high speed using 
any handheld device like phones. QR code provides high data storage capacity, fast scanning, omnidirectional
readability, and many other advantages including, error-correction (so that damaged code can also be read
successfully) and different type of versions. Different varieties of QR code symbols like logo QR code,
encrypted QR code, iQR Code are also available so that user can choose among them according to their need.
Now these days, a QR code is applied in different application streams related to marketing, security, academics etc.
and gain popularity at a really high pace. Day by day more people are getting aware of this technology and use it
accordingly. The popularity of QR code grows rapidly with the growth of smartphone users and thus the QR code
is rapidly arriving at high levels of acceptance worldwide.”
